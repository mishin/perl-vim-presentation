title: Frameworks: Vundle and Pathogen
actions:
    - Both assume git to manage versions
    - Pathogen has simplified config
    - {level: 2, text: "But assumes you'll install/upgrade them yourself"}
    - Vundle requires more `~/.vimrc` modifications
    - {level: 2, text: "But manages installation/upgrades inside Vim"}
    - I use Vundle, but it's just a preference
